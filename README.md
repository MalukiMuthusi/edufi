# EDUFI

A task to develop a single component that is part of a bigger system.

You are engaged by a start-up to implement a new concept called EduFi. EduFi derives from the word Education and Finance. The concept combines education and financial systems to create profit from studying.

Like existing Institute of Higher Learnings (IHLs), students must complete a list of modules to graduate. Each module has multiple classes per week; each class can be taught by different tutor. To complete a module, students need to enrol into the class and clear all the assessments.

Instead of pre-assigning the classes, each student is allocated with tokens (ETI) to bid for classes that are of interest to them. Classes will be awarded to the highest bidders. Students can trade their allocated classes with one another.

At the end of the semester, students are awarded marks according to their performance across all assessments. An amount of tokens equivalent to the marks is awarded to the students. Each module has its own unique token. Students can trade these tokens with one another to increase their final grades.

To facilitate a community of learning and continuous improvement, the platform provides an avenue for everyone to give anonymized rating and comments to students, modules, classes, and tutors. Students can also seek help by posting questions on the platform or form special interest group, where they can discuss with others.
